# CSV_in_C-
Project I had to do in Data Structures.

This C# Program consists of importing two text files then parses and sorts what the shop has avaiable.
The user inputs what they want to buy and the quantity then the subtotal before and after tax as well as
the total is printed. The receipt is stored in a text file in the directory of the file with the name the user input
at the start of the program.

Hope this helps whoever finds this or is just wanting to learn how to Parse and Search through strings, Cheers!
